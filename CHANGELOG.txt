Switch 2.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- General
    - Switch is now compatible with Pyomo 5.6+ (in addition to earlier
      versions).
    - A new --no-post-solve option prevents all post-solve actions (e.g., saving
      variable results).
    - If the user specifies --reload-prior-solution, Switch now behaves as if it
      had just solved the model, i.e., after loading the solution, it runs post-
      solve code unless --no-post-solve is specified (useful for re-running
      reporting code), and it only drops to an interactive Python prompt if the
      user also specifies --interact.
    - A new --no-save-solution disables automatic solution-saving. This saves
      time and disk space for models that won't need to be reloaded later.
    - New --quiet and --no-stream-solver arguments cancel --verbose and
      --stream-solver.
    - A new "--save-expression[s] <name1> <name2> ..." argument can be used to
      save values for any Pyomo Expression object to a .tab file after the model
      is solved (similar to the automatic saving of variable values). This also
      works for Param objects.
    - The --include-module(s), --exclude-module(s), --save-expression(s),
      --suffix(es) and --scenario(s) flags can now be used repeatedly on the
      command line, in options.txt or in scenarios.txt. The include and exclude
      options will be applied in the order they are encountered, in options.txt,
      then scenarios.txt, then the command line.
    - A new --retrieve-cplex-mip-duals flag can be used to support retrieving
      duals for a MIP program from the cplex solver (users must also turn on the
      "duals") suffix. This flag patches the Pyomo-generated cplex command
      script to pass the "change problem fix" command to the solver and then
      solve a second time. This fixes integer variables at their final values,
      then re-solves to obtain duals. This flag is not needed with the cplexamp
      solver.
    - A new balancing.demand_response.iterative module has been added. This was
      formerly in the Hawaii regional package. This moduel performs iterative solutions with any convex demand system, based on a bid-response
      process.
    - New indexed sets have been added to allow efficient selection of groups of
      generators that use a particular technology, fuel or non-fuel energy
      source: GENS_BY_TECHNOLOGY, GENS_BY_FUEL, GENS_BY_NON_FUEL_ENERGY_SOURCE.
    - Generator capacity data is saved to gen_cap.tab instead of gen_cap.txt and
      rows are sorted if user specifies --sorted-output.
    - Even if a model has solver warnings, results will be reported and
      post-solve will be performed if a valid solution is available.
    - A more descriptive warning is given when switch_model.reporting finds an
      uninitialized variable.
    - A warning is given about potential errors parsing arguments in the form
      "--flag=value". Python's argument parsing module can make mistakes with
      these, so "--flag value" is a safer choice.
    - Switch now monkeypatches Pyomo to accelerate reloading prior solutions.
      Previously Pyomo 5.1.1 (and maybe others) took longer to load prior
      solutions than solving the model.
    - At startup, "switch solve-scenarios" will restart jobs that were
      previously interrupted after being started by the same worker (same
      --job-id argument or SWITCH_JOB_ID environment variable). Note that
      workers automatically pull scenarios from the scenario list file until
      there are none left to solve, and avoid solving scenarios that have been
      pulled by other workers. Each worker should be given a unique job ID, and
      this ID should be reused if the worker is terminated and restarted. The
      new behavior ensures that jobs are not abandoned if a worker is restarted.

- Upgrade scripts
    - The upgrade scripts now report changes in module behavior or renamed
      modules while upgrading an inputs directory. This only reports changes to
      modules used in the current model.
    - The hawaii.reserves module is automatically replaced by
      balancing.operating_reserves.areas and
      balancing.operating_reserves.spinning_reserves in the module  list.
    - The hawaii.demand_response module is replaced by
      balancing.demand_response.iterative and hawaii.r_demand_system is replaced
      by balancing.demand_response.iterative.r_demand_system in the module list.
    - "switch_mod" will not be changed to "switch_modelel" if a module file is
      upgraded from 2.0.0b1 to 2.0.0b2 twice.

- Hawaii regional package
    - The hawaii.reserves module has been deprecated and the
      hawaii.demand_response module has been moved (see upgrade scripts)
    - Switch now places limits on down-reserves from pumped-storage hydro.
    - A new --rps-prefer-dist-pv option for hawaii.rps will prevent construction
      of new large PV until 90% of distributed PV potential has been developed.
    - Limits on load-shifting between hours in hawaii.demand_response_simple
      have been formalized.
    - The Hawaii storage energy cost calculation has been fixed.
    - Total production by energy source is reported by hawaii.save_results,
      ad-hoc technologies are added to production_by_technology.tsv, and
      hourly dispatch is disaggregated by non-fuel technologies.
    - Bugs have been fixed in reserve calculation for EVs and in
      hawaii.smooth_dispatch and hawaii.scenario_data.
    - hawaii.smooth_dispatch minimizes total inter-hour change instead of square
      of levels. The old quadratic smoothing method has been moved to
      hawaii.smooth_dispatch.quadratic (slow and possibly buggy).
    - The must-run requirement in hawaii.kalaeloa is turned off when RPS or EV
      share is above 75% (can be overridden by --run-kalaeloa-even-with-high-rps)
    - Support for nominal-dollar fuel price forecasts has been dropped from
      hawaii.scenario_data
    - A new --no-hydrogen flag can be used to deactivate the hydrogen module.
    - The hawaii.ev_advanced module now calculates vehicle fleet emissions.

Switch 2.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First public release of Switch 2. This uses a similar framework to Switch 1,
but with numerous improvements. The most significant are:

- Written in Python instead of AMPL language
- Modular approach, so components can be easily added or removed from model
- Modeling of unit commitment and part load heat rates (optional)
- Generalization of sample timeseries to have arbitrary length instead of single
  days
- Standardized reporting, e.g., automatic export of all variable values
