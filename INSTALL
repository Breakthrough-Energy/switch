Software prerequisites for this project are:

Python v2.7 
    We have not tested this on version 3, and do not have immediate plans
    to do so.
Pyomo v4.0.9682
    We have developed on what is the latest release of Pyomo.
    Earlier versions of Pyomo may be buggy, but later versions may work fine.
A solver such as Cbc https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc or cplex.
    We have not yet been able to get GLPK to work, but have andecdotal
    reports that Cbc tends to be a significantly faster solver.

To use this model, either install this to a standard python library
location or set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to include this
directory. The latter option is probably more useful for developers. On
mac or linux systems, you can do this by adding the following line to
your loging script ~/.profile and updating it to the actual path to your
switch_py directory. This won't work if you use a relative path to
specify your home directory. For example, "~/src/switch_py" will not
work, but "/home/username/src/switch_py" will work.

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/absolute/path/to/switch_py"
