Software prerequisites for this project are:

Python v2.7
    We have not tested this on version 3, and do not have immediate plans
    to do so. We have verified our code works with v2.7.9 and 2.7.10. We
    had some difficulties with our testing framework on v2.7.3.

Pyomo
    To install Pyomo, you can run this command:

        pip install --user -r pip_requirements.txt

    The pip_requirements.txt file records the versions of Pyomo and other
    Python libraries that Switch is tested against.

    Alternatively, you can see Pyomo's instructions for installing Pyomo
    and its dependencies at:
    https://software.sandia.gov/downloads/pub/pyomo/PyomoInstallGuide.html#_installing_pyomo

A solver such as GLPK, Cbc https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc or cplex.
    GLPK is an established open source solver that is easy to install 
    on most platforms. We have andecdotal reports that Cbc tends to
    be significantly faster, but have had difficulties installing it
    on some platforms. Cplex tends to be fast, but is proprietary and
    expensive for non-academics. It is free for registered academics who
    use it for teaching or research.

To use this model, either install this to a standard python library
location or set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to include this
directory. The latter option is probably more useful for developers. On
mac or linux systems, you can do this by adding the following line to
your login script ~/.profile and updating it to the actual path to your
switch_py directory. This won't work if you use a relative path to
specify your home directory. For example, "~/src/switch_py" will not
work, but "/home/username/src/switch_py" will work.

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/absolute/path/to/switch_py"
